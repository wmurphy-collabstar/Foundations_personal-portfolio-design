            <p>
                Born and raised in the Westchester, NY area, I grew up in a classical musician family, 
                and studied to be a professional violinist for over 12 years. 
                Once I was in college, I got excited by understanding how computers worked and making software of my own someday.

            <p>
                After getting my BA at Wesleyan, I worked in IBM's Quantum Computing team as a Client Support Developer for 3 years. 
                I met so many amazing people and acquired many essential hard and soft skills, but I wanted to do more.
                I've been in pursuit of a software development career ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I'm passionate about web development, including the Frontend and UX design components. 
                It is my dream to build web apps that makes a users' lives easier, not harder.
