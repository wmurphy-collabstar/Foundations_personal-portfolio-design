# Foundations: Portfolio Webpage
## Overview
Creating a personal portfolio change is a chance for me to take the knowledge that I've learned about HTML, CSS, and Figma over the past two and a half weeks, and apply it to a page that can one day become my professional portfolio site. 

My goal is to cleanly style my four different sections (Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact) using Flexbox, and demonstrate my understanding of semantic HTML, CSS spacing, typography, UI visual hierarchy, and time management.
## Features
- A header featuring the title of my site, and a navigation bar to scroll through the different sections
- A Home section that includes my professional profile picture, and a summary what makes me who I am today and current interest in Web Development
- An About Me section going into more detail about my background in tech, and where it has taken me to now
- A Projects section featuring 4 projects I've created in the past, with a title, picture, description and summary of what I learned
- A Contact Form with a name, email and message field so someone could hypothetically contact me (but currently, is not functional)
- A footer containing the copyright information, and ways to connect to my social media (being Linkedin and/or Github)
