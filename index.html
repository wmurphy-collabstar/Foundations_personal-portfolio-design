                I am Winona Murphy, and I am from the Westchester area in New York. 
                Raised as a singer and classical violinist, music is a big part of my life.
                I use the courage of performing live onstage, resourcefulness needed to understand complex scores, 
                and the dedication to perfecting each note, in order to expand and deepen my software development skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel sheer joy when I debug a coding problem (even if it's just one missed semicolon), 
                and excitement when appreciating an intuitive, beautiful design.
                Loving both coding and design has lead me to Web Development, and diving deeper into the user experience.
                I currently work as a Web Developer at the Happy Coin, and in my free time, I play with my black cat.

                    Born and raised in the Westchester, NY area, I grew up in a classical musician family, 
                    and studied to be a professional violinist for over 12 years. 
                    Once I was in college, I got excited by understanding how computers worked and making software of my own someday.

                    After getting my BA at Wesleyan, I worked in IBM's Quantum Computing team as a Client Support Developer for 3 years. 
                    I met so many amazing people and acquired many essential hard and soft skills, but I wanted to do more.
                    I've been in pursuit of a software development career ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm passionate about web development, including the Frontend and UX design components. 
                    It is my dream to build web apps that makes a users' lives easier, not harder.
