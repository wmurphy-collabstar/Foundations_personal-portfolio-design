                I am Winona Murphy, and I am from the Westchester area in New York. 
                Raised as a singer and classical violinist, music is a big part of my life.
                I use the courage of performing live onstage, resourcefulness needed to understand complex scores, 
                and the dedication to perfecting each note, in order to expand and deepen my software development skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel sheer joy when I debug a coding problem (even if it's just one missed semicolon), 
                and excitement when appreciating an intuitive, beautiful design.
                Loving both coding and design has lead me to Web Development, and diving deeper into the user experience.
                I currently work as a Web Developer at the Happy Coin, and in my free time, I play with my black cat.
